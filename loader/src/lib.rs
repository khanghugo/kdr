//! Resources fetching should go:
//!
//! 0. The user loads the web site. The web site contains code for .dem, .bsp, ... parsers, ghost generation code, and WebGPU render code.
//!
//! 1. User sends a demo to the browser. A client side demo parser will find which map the demo needs.
//! The map name will be sent to the server.
//!
//! 2. The server will search for the map in its copy of the game.
//! If the map is found, the server will find other related resources and send it to client.
//! This process could be sped up by pre-building .res file for every .bsp, which I conveniently have exactly a tool for that.
//!
//! 3. The client receives .bsp, .mdl, .wad,... The client then starts data processing and feed it into renderer.
//!
//! To make this all efficient, we need two repos.
//! Client repo responsible for hosting all of the web site code to send to server.
//! Server repo responsible for processing map name request.
//!
//! This means, all code in this client repo will think about not having access to file system even though it can be used natively.
